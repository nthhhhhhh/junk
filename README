=====

A static site generator written in Haskell.

While it is a personal generator, it can be used by cloning
this repo.

After cloning, head to the src directory, each directory has
a template (except util). Take note of the id tags prefixed 
with junk. The templates will be copied there. After the 
templates are modified, change to the root of the repo and cabal run.
